Hello


This is my own Crypto Explorer wroten in python using Flask libarys and websocket to stream new blocks.

DEMO no more  ---->  but you will find in time way back Machine  ( explorernew.prux.info )


Is still in work, iam waiting still to get synced on my DEMO site to work on then on last part! 
Is only then to the sync stop and add next blocks if new block is there.  
So may 98% finished of this Project.
May later we need to have better db management for faster Frontend loads, speed improvments, other explorer work with direct rpc connections. 
I want to have at last all tx info in DB, not yet fin. 




Install and RUN  with follow commands:

you need a virtual env. 


cd /projectDirectory

sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv exp
source exp/bin/activate


YOU need to "pip install"  follow libarys


in work.....

You will find out if you try.
